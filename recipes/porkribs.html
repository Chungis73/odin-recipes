    <h1>Korean Sweet and Spicy Pork Spareribs</h1>
    <img src="media/porkpic.jpg" alt="Korean Pork Ribs">
    <h3>Sticky, sweet, savory, and sour fall off the bone pork ribs</h3>
    <p> The ribs are tender and a little bit sweet, but sticky and spicy. Pair them with rice and they're hard to resist.
        As you make the dish, note the difference between Korean-style spareribs and American-style ribs. This recipe for spicy Korean pork ribs contains soy sauce (for some good umami flavor), along with rice wine vinegar and mirin for sweetness and acidity. Finally, the marinade also contains some sugar and honey to make for an unforgettable flavor experience.</p>

        <li>4 pounds pork spareribs, in serving-size pieces</li>
